## How do I bind something to my mouse button?
you do it in ur config.yml ie MOUSE_4 see [here](https://github.com/Skitttyy/Sn0w/blob/main/src/main/java/me/skitttyy/kami/api/feature/module/Module.java#L226).

## How do I request a feature?
I might return to update the client when major changes in the meta happen or if it gets patched entirely doublemine ca whatever just make a issue if its entirely broken. not if its scuffed but if its completely unusable and ill update it to be good again.

## How do I config this client? It is so different then what im used to.
You dont, you ask me to do it. Like I've said this isn't meant for you all to use, and all of my users have strictly used this client only for years. Which is why I haven't sold it.

## Why did you release this client? It was so private?
I have quit anarchy almost entirely since 2022, rarely playing and getting on. I have been pestered and pretty much extorted by my users who are pulling me back to this game to update this client. I have been threatened over and over for the past year of having my client leaked if i dont update. I even opened up my client as a scam because they convinced me too to pay for one of my users FUCKING DRUGS. I was originally going to release it for real and have bon work on the loader, but I ended up just scamming. I have 0 motivation to work on this client.

## What is the history of this client?
i remember seeing a old history post or something abt this client, so i will give u all the true history for u larpers. Sn0w was a kami skid i made for 8b8t, however i didnt know how to actually code. I would change the modules and name in jbytemod and pretend i made a new hack :sob:. One day i was scrolling in the old cool client collectorz server and found hephaestus buildable src or viknet src maybe i don't remember. But yeah i used it and shit updated itand yeah. I eventually got extremely good over time on cheating on servers like hypixel and even 2b2t cc etc where im extremely knowledgable on how anticheats work and how to exploit them. I have found many exploits in mc itself aswell. Eventually i made a deal with 0IMAX where i traded the chorus blink exploit which only sn0w had for phasewalk on cc, and we eeventually made a deal to give over kami5 entirely. Ever since then ive been working on the kami5 base and yeah.

I quit in 2022, I have played since then, but rather to update the client rather then playing. I only played 2b and others to update to 1.21.1 and other stuff. I got so fed up of shoreline being a shit client that I decided to update this to 1.20 my own. I was testing it for my good friend bon55. blah blah blah bro.

I know Ive done bad things, but i always have had a good moral compass. I never fucked with little kids or anything, and always gave peoples accounts back when i felt bad. It was mainly the people that i surrounded myself with that didnt really have a moral compass at all.
